.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBne_buffer\fR
type represents an expandable memory buffer for holding
NUL\-terminated strings. The
data
field points to the beginnning of the string, the length of which is given by the
used
field. The current size of memory allocated is given by the
length
field. It is not recommended that the fields of a buffer are manipulated directly. The
data
pointer may change when the buffer is modified.
.PP
A buffer is created using
ne_buffer_create
or
ne_buffer_ncreate, and destroyed using
ne_buffer_destroy
or
ne_buffer_finish. The functions
ne_buffer_append,
ne_buffer_zappend
and
ne_buffer_concat
are used to append data to a buffer.
.PP
If the string referenced by the
data
pointer is modified directly (rather than using one of the functions listed above),
\fBne_buffer_altered\fR
must be called.
